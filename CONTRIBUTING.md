# Contributing to Nightingale

Thanks for your interest. Do note that this is in super early stages of development, so the codebase is unstable. I'd advise you to wait for a month or two or three before contributing.

> Nightingale is a learning-driven project. Code quality matters more than velocity.

## Ground Rules
- Keep changes small and focused
- Follow existing code style
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Discuss large changes in an issue first

## Development
```bash
cargo fmt
cargo clippy
cargo test
