# Nightingale

Nightingale is an experimental, high-performance code editor written in Rust.

## Status
Early development. APIs and architecture are unstable.
> Nightingale is a learning-driven project. Code quality matters more than velocity.

## Goals
- Correctness over cleverness
- Async-first architecture
- Clean internal abstractions

## Building
```bash
cargo run
